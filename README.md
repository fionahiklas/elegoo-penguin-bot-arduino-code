## Overview 

The [Official ELEGOO Penguin Bot repo](https://github.com/elegooofficial/ELEGOO-Penguin-Bot-V2.0) just contains a bunch of zip files which isn't entirely helpful when working with the code!

This repo contains the Arduino code from the zip file.  I might start hacking 
this on different branches to play around but there should always be one clean 
branch with the original code.
